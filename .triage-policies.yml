            This issue has been open for too long (since {{updated_at}}).
            And is still not resolved. Maybe no one needs it?
            It would be closed in 10 days automatically.

            In case you really need this issue,
            tell me so by writing "This is still on scope".
            And remove ~"validation:stale" label.

            In case it is ok to be closed, just do not touch it.
            And it will be automatically closed. Or close it right way.

            Thanks!

            The deadline was missed.
            This incident will be reported to the stakeholders.
            Status of this task needs to be discussed further.
            Most likely, it still makes sence to finish it,
            but it might be already useless.

            Looks like this merge request is stale.
            It was last updated at {{updated_at}}

            Why no one is working on it?

            How can this be resolved?
            1. {{author}}, mark it a WIP if it has "Work in Progress" state.
               Use `/wip` command to do that.
               Then remove ~"validation:stale" label
            2. Ping the reviewer to submit a review,
               if there's one and it is a right time for that {{assignee}}
            3. In case you cannot recieve a single review
               for more than two hours, ping your architect
            4. Merge it if possible. Make sure to rebase it.
               Or assign our merge bot (@kira\-bot) to rebase / merge it for you
            5. Apply ~"validation:invalid" label in case it was created by a mistake
